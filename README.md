# Youtube-Recommendation-System
The purpose of this project is to build a youtube recommendation system based on a users previously watched videos. We have all found that the youtube system isn't the greatest and we want to hopefully improve it. We will be doing this by using technologies such as Airflow and Spark to gather, clean and analyze data. Then we want to create a GUI to display our results.
