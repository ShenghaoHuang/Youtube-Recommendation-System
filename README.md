# YouTube Recommendation Engine 


***
In our group of 3, we often notice that YouTube doesn't always recommend the best videos for us to watch. We get a range of various different videos or even videos we have already watched. Using YouTube's API and Machine Learning we aim to create a better video recommendation system based on videos you have watched.
